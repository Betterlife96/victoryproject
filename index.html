        <h2>Objective:</h2>
        <p>
          According to the International Energy Agency, it is estimated that
          around USD 2.8 trillion will be invested in energy in 2023, with more
          than USD 1.7 trillion going to clean energy, including renewable
          power, nuclear, grids, storage, low-emission fuels, efficiency
          improvements, and end-use renewables and electrification 1. The energy
          industry is undergoing a significant transformation as the world moves
          towards sustainable and renewable energy sources. Some of the most
          impactful trends in the new energy sector over the next 12 months
          include the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to forecast demand and
          manage the distribution of resources, the emergence of new and exotic
          sources of energy from laboratory and pilot projects, and the growth
          of the renewable energy market, which is set to grow from $880 billion
          to nearly $2 trillion by 2030

        <h3>SOLAR PANELS</h3> 
        <section>
          <p>Is the photovoltaic system worth renting? The NRW consumer advice
            centre shows what to look out for in solar rental offers. Consumer
            Advice Centre NRW © Consumer Advice Centre NRW Producing your own
            solar power, becoming less dependent on energy suppliers and saving
            money in the long term – that's what the photovoltaic system (PV
            system) on your own roof stands for.</p>
            <p>However, purchase and
              installation are initially associated with high costs and
              corresponding planning and administrative effort. So why not just rent
              the solar system instead of buying it? "There are several larger
              providers on the market who are active throughout Germany, as well as
              some regional energy suppliers and municipal utilities that offer PV
              systems for rent," explains Sören Demandt, energy expert at the NRW
              consumer advice center. However, such a rental offer can be an
              alternative to buying if you want to keep the effort and cost risk as
              low as possible and take into account the comparatively higher total
              costs." How to compare investments and what to look out for in
              photovoltaic rental offers has been compiled by the NRW Consumer
              Advice Centre in the following tips. </p>

        <section>
          <p>Differences between renting and buying a PV system When buying a PV system, a specialist company is
            commissioned with planning and installation. After commissioning, the
            owner and operator are fully responsible for the system. This includes
            all maintenance, insurance and reporting obligations. The advantage
            lies in full control in the selection of installed components, such as
            a battery storage system or a wallbox. The disadvantages are a higher
            investment amount and registration formalities. With a solar system
            for rent, on the other hand, there is no need for a large initial
            investment. Instead, a monthly rental fee is paid. The advantage of
            this is that, in addition to the installation and planning costs, the
            rental usually also includes additional services such as maintenance
            and insurance. Over the entire rental period, usually at least 20
            years, a fixed monthly rent amount must be paid. The solar system
            remains in the possession of the provider for the entire duration of
            the contract. After that, in most cases, the system is taken over by
            the customer. ens when the battery storage system Information on the
